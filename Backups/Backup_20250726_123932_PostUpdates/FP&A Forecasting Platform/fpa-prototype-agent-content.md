#### In AI Assistant Chat
```
User: "Why did our forecast accuracy drop last month?"

[Variance Detective Agent activating...]

Assistant Response:
"I've investigated your forecast accuracy drop. Here's what the Variance Detective found:

📊 **Accuracy decreased from 92% to 87% (-5pp)**

**Root Causes:**
1. **New Product Launch** (40% of variance)
   - Limited historical data for ML models
   - Higher than expected demand volatility
   
2. **Competitor Action** (35% of variance)
   - Unexpected price cut in key markets
   - Our models didn't anticipate competitive response
   
3. **Economic Indicators** (25% of variance)
   - Fed decision came 2 weeks earlier than expected
   - Market reacted differently than historical patterns

**Actions Taken:**
✓ Forecast Intelligence Agent has incorporated new patterns
✓ Scenario Architect created 3 contingency plans
✓ Accuracy already recovering (currently at 89.2%)

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Review competitive intelligence inputs monthly
2. Increase new product forecast ranges for first 6 months
3. Add Fed decision probability weighing to models

Would you like me to show you the updated forecast with these improvements?"
