## Platform Count Summary

Current count: 17 platforms

To reach 21 platforms, we could consider:
- Breaking out specialized platforms for cross-functional needs
- Creating innovation/AI development platforms
- Adding data/analytics platforms

OR we could keep it at 17-18 platforms if that better reflects logical groupings.

---

## Summary by Function:
- **Procure to Pay**: 3 platforms
- **Order to Cash**: 2 platforms 
- **Cost Accounting**: 1 platform
- **Controllership**: 4 platforms
- **Corporate Finance**: 3 platforms
- **FP&A**: 2 platforms
- **Investor Relations**: 2 platforms

**Total**: 17 platforms

---

## Questions for Review:

1. Should we stick with 17 logical platforms or expand to 21?

2. Is the Treasury split across 2 platforms appropriate (operations vs. risk/analytics)?

3. Should Investor Relations be consolidated to 1 platform given only 5 activities?

4. Are the Controllership groupings logical (Close, Control, Regulatory, Statutory)?

5. Should we add cross-functional platforms for:
   - Data & Analytics Platform
   - AI Development Platform  
   - Finance Collaboration Platform
   - Working Capital Optimization Platform

Please review and provide feedback on this mapping structure.
