| Fulfillment | OS, SM, NC | None |

#### Collections Management
**Critical Process** with 72% time savings

| Step | AI Agents | Usage Frequency |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Strategy | CM, CP, AG | High |
| Contact | CC, PM, DO | Medium |
| Follow-up | CA, PM, NC | PM used 2x |

**Agent PM (Promise Manager)** identified as high-frequency agent in collections.

### 3. Record to Report (R2R)

#### Period Close
**Most Complex Workflow**: 5 steps, 15 agents, 6 human checkpoints

| Step | Complexity | Human Oversight |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Close Prep | High | Strategic Decision |
| Subledger Close | Very High | Exception Handling |
| Journal Processing | High | Approval, Compliance |
| Accruals | Medium | Quality Assurance |
| Statements | High | Final Sign-off |

**Critical Agents**:
- JE (Journal Entry Creator) - used across multiple R2R processes
- BR (Balance Reconciler) - cross-functional with high usage
- EC (Exception Coordinator) - critical for automation

### 4. Cross-Functional Agent Analysis

#### Most Used Agents (Top 10)

| Agent ID | Name | Total Usage | Functions | Criticality |
|----------|------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| AV | Approval Validator | 8+ | P2P, O2C, R2R | HIGH |
| NC | Notification Center | 7+ | All | HIGH |
| EC | Exception Coordinator | 6+ | P2P, O2C, R2R | HIGH |
| PM | Performance Monitor | 6+ | P2P, O2C | HIGH |
| DQ | Data Quality Guardian | 5+ | P2P, R2R | HIGH |
| CA | Various* | 5+ | Multiple | HIGH |
| VM | Vendor Master Manager | 4+ | P2P | MEDIUM |
| BR | Balance Reconciler | 4+ | R2R | MEDIUM |
| TC | Tax Calculator | 3+ | P2P, O2C | MEDIUM |
| DA | Data Aggregator | 3+ | All | MEDIUM |

*CA represents different agents with same ID in different contexts

#### Cross-Functional Champions
