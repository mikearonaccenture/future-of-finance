# Prototype Framework Template

## How to Create New Finance Function Prototypes

This template provides a consistent framework for developing prototypes for each finance function area. Use this as a guide when expanding beyond FP&A.

## [Function Name] Prototypes

### Step 1: Analyze Current State Processes

List all activities from the taxonomy for this function:
- Process 1
- Process 2
- Process 3
- etc.

### Step 2: Identify Transformation Opportunities

For each process, identify:
- **Pain Points**: What's broken today?
- **AI Opportunity**: How can AI/ML help?
- **Value Proposition**: What's the business impact?
- **Feasibility**: Technical complexity and data requirements

### Step 3: Group into Logical Prototypes

Combine related processes into 2-3 comprehensive prototypes that tell a compelling story.

## Best Practices for Prototype Development

### 1. Start with the User Journey
- Map current pain points in detail
- Identify moments of delight in future state
- Focus on emotional impact of transformation

### 2. Make it Tangible
- Use real-world data examples
- Show actual time/cost savings
- Include familiar interfaces with AI enhancement

### 3. Balance Vision with Reality
- Show what's possible today
- Tease what's coming tomorrow
- Be honest about implementation effort

### 4. Create "Aha!" Moments
- Focus on 2-3 jaw-dropping features
- Build up to reveal dramatically
- Quantify impact immediately

### 5. Address Concerns Proactively
- Job security: "Elevates your role"
- Complexity: "Easier than current process"
- Trust: "Explainable AI with audit trails"
- Cost: "ROI in months, not years"
