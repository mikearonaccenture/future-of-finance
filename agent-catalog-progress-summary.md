# Agent Catalog Progress Summary

**Date**: 2024-01-27
**Progress**: 9/63 workflows completed (14.3%)

## Agent Statistics

### Overall Numbers
- **Total Unique Agents**: 134
- **Total Agent Uses**: 162 (across 9 workflows)
- **Average Agents per Workflow**: 18
- **Agent Reuse Instances**: 28

### By Domain
| Domain | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| General (GEN-*) | 60 | 44.8% |
| FP&A (FPA-*) | 23 | 17.2% |
| Procure to Pay (PTP-*) | 51 | 38.0% |

### Reuse Analysis
- **Most Reused Agents**:
  1. GEN-COMPLY-001 (3 uses)
  2. GEN-WORKFLOW-001 (2 uses)
  3. GEN-ANOMALY-001 (2 uses)
  4. PTP-SPENDANALYZE-001 (3 uses)
  5. FPA-MONITOR-001 (2 uses)

- **Reuse Rate by Workflow**:
  1. AP Reporting: 40% (6/15)
  2. Travel & Expense: 28% (8/28)
  3. Budgeting: 71% (10/14)
  4. Vendor Statement: 20% (3/15)

### Quality Metrics
- **Zero Duplicates**: No exact duplicate agents created
- **Minimal Overlaps**: Only 2 potential merges identified
- **Cross-Functional Success**: 60 GEN-* agents enable reuse
- **Domain Specificity**: Clear separation between domains

## Key Insights

### What's Working Well
1. **Naming Convention**: DOMAIN-FUNCTION-SEQUENCE is clear and scalable
2. **Reuse Growing**: Later workflows show higher reuse rates
3. **Cross-Functional Design**: GEN-* agents successfully bridge domains
4. **Business Alignment**: Agents match actual workflow needs

### Areas to Monitor
1. **Analytics Agents**: Multiple analysis-related agents (trend, pattern, metric)
2. **Reporting Agents**: Several report generation agents
3. **Validation Agents**: Various validation and checking agents

### Recommendations Going Forward
1. **Continue Current Approach**: The methodology is sound
2. **Watch for Patterns**: As we complete more workflows, consolidation opportunities will emerge
3. **Document Distinctions**: When similar agents exist, clearly document why both are needed
4. **Target 150-200 Total**: We're on track for this range across 63 workflows

## Next Steps
- Continue with remaining P2P workflows (6 more)
- Then move to Order to Cash (O2C) workflows
- Maintain focus on reuse and avoiding duplicates
- Update comprehensive catalog after each function
