## Duplication Analysis

### Clear Duplicates Found: 0
- No exact duplicates identified

### Potential Overlaps to Monitor:
1. **Presentation Agents**: GEN-PRESENT-001 vs GEN-PRESENT-002 (could merge)
2. **Approval Agents**: GEN-APPROVE-001 vs GEN-APPROVE-002 (keep both - different functions)
3. **Pattern Analysis**: GEN-PATTERN-001 (general) vs domain-specific analyzers

### Cross-Functional Reuse Success:
- **High Reuse Agents**: GEN-WORKFLOW-001, GEN-COMPLY-001, GEN-ANOMALY-001
- **Domain Bridges**: Several GEN-* agents successfully bridge multiple functions

## Key Insights

1. **Good Domain Separation**: Clear distinction between GEN-* (general), FPA-* (FP&A), and PTP-* (Procure to Pay)
2. **Minimal Duplication**: Only 1-2 potential merges out of 125 agents (< 2%)
3. **Healthy Reuse**: 35 instances of agent reuse across workflows
4. **Right-Sized**: Average of ~15 agents per workflow is reasonable

## Recommendations

1. **Continue Current Approach**: The naming convention and careful analysis is working
2. **Monitor These Areas**:
   - Payment processing (multiple payment-related agents)
   - Analytics/reporting (several analysis agents)
   - Approval workflows (multiple approval agents)
3. **Consider Future Consolidation**:
   - After all 63 workflows, review for consolidation opportunities
   - Focus on GEN-* agents that might merge
