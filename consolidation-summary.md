# Workflow Consolidation Summary

## Completed Consolidations

### 1. Procure to Pay ✅
- Consolidated 3 workflows from `procure-to-pay-additional-workflows.ts` into main file
- Deleted additional file
- Result: Single `procure-to-pay-workflows.ts` with 8 workflows

### 2. FP&A ✅
- Consolidated 1 workflow from `fpa-additional-workflows.ts` into main file
- Deleted additional file
- Result: Single `fpa-workflows.ts` with all workflows

## Remaining Work

### 3. Corporate Finance
- Need to consolidate `corporate-finance-additional-workflows.ts` (1 workflow) into main
- File contains: Cash Management and Banking workflow

### 4. Investor Relations
- Need to consolidate `investor-relations-additional-workflows.ts` into main
- Need to check content

### 5. Controllership
- Special case: No main file
- Has two files:
  - `controllership-additional-workflows.ts`
  - `controllership-statutory-workflows.ts`
- Need to create `controllership-workflows.ts` and merge both

## Benefits Achieved
1. ✅ Reduced file count by 2 so far
2. ✅ Single import source per function
3. ✅ Easier navigation
4. ✅ Better code organization

## Next Steps
Would you like me to continue with the remaining consolidations? This will:
- Consolidate Corporate Finance workflows
- Consolidate Investor Relations workflows
- Create a main Controllership file and merge the two existing files
- Delete all redundant files

This will result in one workflow file per finance function, making the codebase much cleaner.
