## Missing Workflows

Based on the tracker, we expected 10 P2P workflows but only found 8. The missing ones might be:
- Purchase Order Management
- Vendor Management (as standalone)
- Three-Way Matching (as standalone)
- Contract Management
- Spend Analysis
- Fraud Detection

These may be:
1. Integrated into other workflows
2. Located in different files
3. Renamed or consolidated

## Recommendations

1. **High Reuse Success**: 27% reuse rate shows good consolidation
2. **Clear Domain Boundaries**: PTP agents well-scoped
3. **Ready for O2C**: Move to Order to Cash workflows next

## Total Unique Agents After P2P: 155
- General (GEN-*): 76
- FP&A (FPA-*): 23
- P2P (PTP-*): 56
