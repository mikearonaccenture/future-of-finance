# Critical Workflow Step Analysis

## Workflows That Need More Steps

### Too Few Steps (2-3 steps) - Need Expansion:
1. **Receipt & Scanning** (2 steps) → Should be 5-6 steps
   - Missing: Policy compliance check, categorization, approval routing, expense report integration, reimbursement processing
   
2. **Invoice Processing** (3 steps) → Should be 6-7 steps  
   - Missing: Duplicate checking, tax validation, coding/allocation, approval workflow, posting preparation
   
3. **Payment Processing** (3 steps) → Should be 5-6 steps
   - Missing: Payment batch creation, bank file generation, confirmation matching, failed payment handling
   
4. **Financial Statements & Disclosures** (3 steps) → Should be 6-7 steps
   - Missing: Data collection, consolidation, review cycles, disclosure preparation, XBRL tagging, filing
   
5. **Statutory and GAAP Reporting Adjustments** (3 steps) → Should be 5-6 steps
   - Missing: Adjustment identification, documentation, review/approval, posting, reconciliation
   
6. **Integrated Enterprise Planning** (3 steps) → Should be 5-6 steps
   - Missing: Data integration, model building, scenario planning, consolidation, review cycles
   
7. **Competitive Intelligence** (3 steps) → Should be 5-6 steps
   - Missing: Data sourcing, analysis framework, insight generation, validation, distribution

### Potentially Light (4 steps) - Review Needed:
1. **Accounts Payable Reconciliation** - Could expand to show GL reconciliation, vendor reconciliation, aging analysis
2. **Lease Accounting** - Missing lease modification handling, impairment testing
3. **Perform Financial Reporting** - Could add variance analysis, commentary preparation
4. **Perform Joint Venture Accounting** - Missing partner reporting, distribution calculations
5. **Strategic or LR Planning** - Could add environmental scanning, capability assessment
6. **Budgeting** - Missing budget consolidation, variance tracking setup
7. **Dynamic Forecasting** - Could add rolling forecast mechanics, assumption updates
8. **Decision Support & Modeling** - Missing model validation, sensitivity testing
9. **Investor Relations** - Could expand stakeholder mapping, messaging development
10. **Quarterly Earnings** - Missing earnings guidance, Q&A preparation
11. **Stock Surveillance** - Could add insider trading monitoring, peer analysis
12. **Investment Community Relationship Mgmt** - Missing roadshow planning, feedback loops

## Recommendations:
1. No workflow should have fewer than 4 steps (except very simple processes)
2. Most financial workflows realistically have 5-8 steps
3. Complex workflows (like Invoice to Pay, Period Close) correctly have 7-8 steps
4. We should expand the identified workflows to be more comprehensive
