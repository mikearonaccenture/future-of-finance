# Workflow-Driven AI Agent Catalog Implementation

## Executive Summary

We're implementing a **top-down, workflow-driven approach** to building our AI agent catalog. Instead of trying to organize 519 undefined agents, we're systematically reviewing our 63 workflows to build the catalog correctly from the ground up.

### Key Principle
> "Agents are tools that serve workflows, not independent entities"

## Why This Approach?

### Problems with Bottom-Up Approach
- 519 agents with no documentation
- No clear purpose for most agents  
- Massive guesswork about functionality
- High risk of incorrect consolidation

### Benefits of Workflow-Driven Approach
✅ **Business Aligned**: Every agent tied to specific business activity  
✅ **Natural Deduplication**: Reuse becomes obvious  
✅ **Clear Documentation**: Purpose known from workflow context  
✅ **Manageable Scope**: 63 workflows vs 519 mystery agents  
✅ **Quality First**: Build it right from the start

## Implementation Framework

### 1. Source of Truth Hierarchy
```
7 Finance Functions
  └── 63 Activities  
      └── 17 Platforms
          └── AI Agents (properly documented)
```

### 2. Systematic Process
For each workflow:
1. **Extract** current agents from workflow steps
2. **Check** if suitable agent already exists in catalog
3. **Create** new agent with proper ID if needed
4. **Update** workflow with new agent IDs
5. **Document** in catalog with full context

### 3. Naming Convention
Format: `DOMAIN-FUNCTION-SEQUENCE`
- Example: `FPA-FORECAST-001`
- Domains: FPA, RTR, PTP, OTC, TAX, TRS, CRP, CTL, INV, GEN
- See `agent-naming-conventions.md` for full guide

## Created Deliverables

### Core Documents
1. **`workflow-driven-agent-catalog-plan.md`**
   - Complete 8-week implementation plan
   - Daily checklists and processes
   - Risk mitigation strategies

2. **`workflow-review-tracker.md`**
   - Tracks all 63 workflows
   - Progress metrics
   - Platform and function groupings

3. **`agent-naming-conventions.md`**
   - Comprehensive naming guide
   - Decision trees
   - Best practices

### Technical Assets
4. **`ai-agent-master-catalog.ts`**
   - TypeScript structure for catalog
   - Helper functions
   - Statistics tracking

5. **`workflow-reviews/` directory**
   - Individual review documents
   - `TEMPLATE-workflow-review.md`

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: FP&A Focus
- Review 10-12 FP&A workflows
- Establish core agents
- Set patterns for reuse

### Week 2: RTR Workflows  
- Review 15 RTR workflows
- Heavy reuse expected
- Identify cross-functional patterns

### Weeks 3-6: Remaining Functions
- P2P, O2C, Treasury, Tax, Corporate Finance, Controllership
- Progressive catalog building
- Cross-functional optimization

### Week 7: Optimization
- Review full catalog
- Consolidate where appropriate
- Finalize relationships

### Week 8: Implementation
- Update all workflow files
- Create compatibility layer
- Generate documentation

## Expected Outcomes

### Quantitative Goals
- ✅ All 63 workflows reviewed
- ✅ 100% agent documentation
- ✅ <200 total unique agents (from 519)
- ✅ >30% cross-functional reuse

### Qualitative Goals
- ✅ Clear business purpose for every agent
- ✅ No duplicate agents
- ✅ Scalable for future growth
- ✅ Easy agent discovery

## Daily Workflow

### Morning
1. Review progress tracker
2. Select 2-3 workflows
3. Prepare workflow files

### During Review
1. Extract agents from workflow
2. Check catalog for reuse
3. Create/update agents
4. Update workflow code
5. Document in review template

### End of Day
1. Update tracking spreadsheet
2. Commit catalog changes
3. Note patterns for next day

## Success Metrics

We'll track:
- Workflows reviewed (target: 2-3/day)
- New agents created vs reused
- Cross-functional reuse rate
- Time per workflow review
- Catalog growth rate

## Next Steps

1. **Today**: Begin with first FP&A workflow
2. **This Week**: Complete 10+ workflows
3. **Weekly**: Review progress and adjust approach
4. **End Goal**: Clean, documented, business-aligned agent catalog

## Quick Reference

**Key Files**:
- Plan: `workflow-driven-agent-catalog-plan.md`
- Tracker: `workflow-review-tracker.md`
- Naming: `agent-naming-conventions.md`
- Catalog: `ai-agent-master-catalog.ts`
- Reviews: `workflow-reviews/[workflow-name]-review.md`

**Process**: Extract → Check → Create/Reuse → Update → Document

**Remember**: Quality over speed. Better to do it right than do it twice.
