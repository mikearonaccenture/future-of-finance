### 🎯 Approach Confirmation

We're following the agreed approach:
1. **Analyze each workflow activity** to understand business needs
2. **Determine correct AI agents** based on actual requirements
3. **Create new agents or reuse existing** with proper IDs
4. **Update workflow files** with new agent IDs
5. **Document everything** in our catalog

### 📈 Key Metrics

- **Average Review Time**: 30-40 minutes per workflow
- **Reuse Rate**: Increasing (0% → 47% → 26% → 71% → 4% → 20%)
- **Cross-functional Agents Emerging**: 
  - GEN-DATA-001 (Data gathering)
  - GEN-PATTERN-001 (Pattern analysis)
  - GEN-INSIGHT-001 (Insights)
  - GEN-WORKFLOW-001 (Workflow management)
  - GEN-CURRENCY-001 (FX management)
  - Many more...

### 🔍 Agent Naming Pattern

Following consistent format: `DOMAIN-FUNCTION-SEQUENCE`
- **FPA-**: Financial Planning & Analysis specific
- **PTP-**: Procure to Pay specific
- **GEN-**: General/Cross-functional
- **RTR-**: Record to Report (upcoming)
- **OTC-**: Order to Cash (upcoming)

### 📋 Next Steps

Continue systematically through P2P workflows:
- Procurement Card Administration
- Employee Expense Management
- Vendor Onboarding
- Purchase Requisition to PO
- Contract Management
- Spend Analytics
- Supplier Risk Management
- Payment Run Management

Then move to Order to Cash (O2C) workflows.

### 💡 Insights So Far

1. **Clear patterns emerging** - Many workflows need similar base capabilities
2. **Domain-specific needs** - Each function has unique requirements
3. **High reuse potential** - General agents being used across functions
4. **Quality approach working** - Taking time to analyze properly pays off
